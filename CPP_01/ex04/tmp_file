Create a program that 
takes three parameters 
in the following order: 
a filename and
two strings, s1 and s2.
It must open the file
and copy its content into a new file
replace, replacing every 
occurrence of s1 with s2.
Using C file manipulation functions 
is forbidden and will be considered cheating. All
OK ok
